## Common problems with Peugeot 407 and how to avoid them
 
Like any car, the Peugeot 407 can have some problems and breakdowns over time. Some of these issues are more common and serious than others, and can affect the performance, safety and comfort of your car. Here are some of the most common problems with Peugeot 407 and how to avoid them or fix them if they occur.
 
### Power Steering Problems
 
The power steering system on the 407 is known to experience a wide variety of issues such as locking itself in place or completely failing. The most common power steering system problems include the steering wheel being stiff or the steering wheel becoming way too hot to touch. Peugeot calls this system the "EPAS" system[^1^].
 
To avoid these problems, you should check the power steering fluid level regularly and top it up if needed. You should also inspect the power steering hoses and connections for any leaks or damage. If you notice any signs of trouble with the power steering system, such as warning lights, noises or vibrations, you should take your car to a Peugeot dealer or a qualified mechanic as soon as possible. The power steering system may need to be replaced or repaired depending on the cause and severity of the problem.
 
### Electrical Problems
 
The 407 can also suffer from various electrical problems that can affect the lights, wipers, windows, doors, airbags, cruise control and other features. Some of these problems are caused by faulty wiring, sensors, switches, relays or fuses. Others are due to software glitches or compatibility issues with aftermarket devices[^2^].
 
To avoid these problems, you should always use genuine Peugeot parts and accessories when replacing or installing anything on your car. You should also avoid modifying or tampering with the electrical system without proper knowledge and tools. If you experience any electrical problems with your car, you should check the fuses first and replace any blown ones. You should also scan your car with a diagnostic tool to see if there are any error codes stored in the computer. If the problem persists or is serious, you should take your car to a Peugeot dealer or a qualified mechanic for further diagnosis and repair.
 
### Suspension Issues
 
The suspension system on the 407 is designed to provide a smooth and comfortable ride, but it can also develop some issues over time that can affect the handling, stability and comfort of your car. Some of the most common suspension issues include noises, creaks, knocks or clunks from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or turning corners. These issues can be caused by worn or loose parts such as bushings, bearings, joints, springs or shocks[^2^].
 
To avoid these issues, you should inspect your suspension system regularly and look for any signs of wear, damage or corrosion. You should also check the tire pressure and alignment and make sure they are within the recommended range. If you notice any suspension issues with your car, you should take it to a Peugeot dealer or a qualified mechanic for further diagnosis and repair. The suspension system may need to be adjusted, lubricated or replaced depending on the cause and severity of the problem.
