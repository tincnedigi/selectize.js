You can find the latest version of the game in the Koikatsu Repack, which is updated regularly by the author. You can also check out some screenshots of the game's character creation mode, called CharaStudio, which was taken on 2019-08-29 at 23:11:14. However, be aware that the game may not have a lot of content or variety in terms of gameplay. Some users have compared it to Sexy Beach Premium Resort, which was a disappointing release from the same developer. If you want to save some disk space or bandwidth, you can also try downloading fitgirl's repack, which is a compressed version of the game.
