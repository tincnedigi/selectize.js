Red Giant, a company that creates tools for filmmakers, editors, visual effects artists and motion designers, has announced the release of an update for its new multi-host app library of GPU-accelerated tools, Red Giant Universe. This library allows its members to access a wide variety of tools and effects that can be used to create stunning visual projects across multiple host applications, such as Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro and OFX-compatible software. The latest update (v1.2.0) adds nine new free and premium effects to the library, as well as updates that enhance the features and functionality of several existing Universe tools. With this update, the library now offers a total of 59 effects and transitions that can be used to enhance video and motion graphics projects.
  
Some of the new effects and transitions that are included in the update are Chromatic Glow, Knoll Light Transition, Holomatrix EZ, ToonIt Sketch and ToonIt Paint. Chromatic Glow is a free effect that adds a colorful glow to the highlights of an image, creating a dreamy or futuristic look. Knoll Light Transition is a premium transition that creates a lens flare effect that animates across the image as it changes from one clip to another. Holomatrix EZ is a free effect that simulates the look of a hologram or a bad TV signal, with options to adjust the distortion, scan lines and color. ToonIt Sketch and ToonIt Paint are premium effects that transform the image into a cartoon-like drawing or painting, with controls for the style, detail and edge quality.

The update adds a new Film Gate menu that allows users to choose from different film formats and aspect ratios.

The update adds a new Slide Source menu that allows users to use their own images as slides. CrumplePop Fisheye Fixer is a free effect that corrects the distortion caused by fisheye lenses, such as those used on GoPro cameras. The update adds support for more lens types and camera models.
